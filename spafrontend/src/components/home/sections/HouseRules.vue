        <li>Any disruptive or disrespectful behavior that disturbs other guests or hotel staff will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li>PareServe is a smoke-free property. Smoking is strictly prohibited in all guest rooms and indoor public areas. Designated smoking areas are available outside the hotel.</li>
